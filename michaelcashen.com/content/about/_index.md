I'm Michael, from New Zealand, living in Tokyo.ã€€I have a wife and three kids and we have a family New Years's card at [ake-ome.com](https://ake-ome.com).

I'm currently the Japan Country Manager for [Engage Squared](https://engagesq.com/), and I previously co-founded [Neural Squared](https://www.neural2.com/) though I am not (or at least I hope I am not) square nor squared.

I started a compamy [Hypotize](https://www.hypotize.com/) a long time ago and keep it around just in case I have any more great money losing ideas like [selling t-shirts](https://www.instagram.com/fishionista.shop/). 

On the weekends, along with a couple of other volunteers, I run the [Miura Computer Club](https://www.miura.io/), teaching kids in Miura City, Kanagawa a little about computers. 

I look a little like this, tho on most days with a little more color and more chin definition:

I've lived in Tokyo (and Kanagawa) for over 20 years, and speak pretty good Japanese and English. I studied computer science at the [University of Electro-Communications](https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/).
